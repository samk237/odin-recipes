        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mediterranean baked fish is a light and flavorful dish featuring fresh fish fillets baked with vibrant Mediterranean ingredients. Typically, white fish like cod, snapper, or sea bass is seasoned with olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and aromatic herbs such as oregano, thyme, or parsley. The fish is baked with a medley of vegetables like tomatoes, olives, onions, and bell peppers, which enhance the dish with natural sweetness and briny depth. The result is a tender, flaky fish infused with bright citrus and herbaceous flavors, making it a healthy and satisfying meal. Often served with rice, couscous, or crusty bread, this dish embodies the fresh and wholesome essence of Mediterranean cuisine.</p>
