        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A butter ribeye is a rich and flavorful steak dish featuring a well-marbled ribeye cut cooked with butter to enhance its tenderness and taste. The steak is typically seasoned with salt, pepper, and optional herbs like rosemary or thyme before being seared in a hot pan or grilled to the desired doneness. During cooking, butter is added and basted over the steak, infusing it with a deep, nutty richness. The result is a juicy, tender ribeye with a beautifully caramelized crust, complemented by the buttery, aromatic flavors. Often served with sides like mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a crisp salad, a butter ribeye is a luxurious and satisfying meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 ribeye steak (1–1.5 inches thick)</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic (smashed)</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary or thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
