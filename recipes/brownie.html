        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Brownies are rich, chocolatey baked treats with a dense, fudgy, or cakey texture. Made with simple ingredients like cocoa, butter, and sugar, they have a deep chocolate flavor and a slightly crisp top. Whether enjoyed plain or with mix-ins like nuts or chocolate chips, brownies are a beloved dessert that pairs well with milk, ice cream, or coffee.</p>
