        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of wide, 
            flat pasta sheets layered with rich, savory fillings. 
            Traditional lasagna features layers of pasta, 
            a hearty meat or vegetable sauce, creamy ricotta or béchamel, 
            and melted cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. 
            The dish is baked until golden and bubbly, resulting in a comforting, flavorful meal with a perfect balance of textures—tender pasta, rich sauce, and gooey cheese. 
            Variations include vegetarian versions with spinach and ricotta, or different proteins like chicken or seafood. Often served as a main course, lasagna is a beloved comfort food enjoyed worldwide.</p>
